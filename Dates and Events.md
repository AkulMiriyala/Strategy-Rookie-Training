## **Major Dates and Events & Timing**
- Introduction Interest Meeting: Meet the rest of the team and figure out if Robotics is a good fit for you, and specifically the Strategy subgroup. 
- Pre-season: During this time, rookies are trained in Strategy through a variety of different assignments. 
- Kickoff: Weekend in January when FIRST releases the game video and manual. During this time, the whole team meets and plans designs for the robot. During Kickoff, strategy absorbs and reads the entirety of the game manual and serves as an advisor to design groups as someone who can explain the game and its rules, as well as general robotics concepts. On top of this, strategy does many presentations, ranging from ideas regarding the game to general information.  
- Build Season: Build season is when we build and test the robot. It has several parts.
    - Planning: From kickoff to around the next meeting. During this time teams create and present robot ideas and we combine or work on them. During the planning phase, Strategy plays a key role to make sure all the designs and strategy fit within the rules. We will also be doing plenty of brainstorming of not only mechanisms but also possible game and match strategies. This year Strategy will have the capability and responsibility of committing ideas of themselves and others to CAD. 
    - Build Time: Technical subgroups will meet and work on the robot physically. During this time Strategy will help out CAD, contribute to the tech binder and other Outreach documents, and begin Driver/Buttonman/Technician training.
- Competition Season: We compete with the robot. Strategy will be doing scouting and advanced data analysis and the strategy lead will serve as the drive team coach. 
- After Season: Whether we win or lose, we will compete more in competions in the post season.
- Summer Season: This time is usually used to reflect on what happened the previous year and work on improvement. There are no meetings durring this time, but mandatory strategy training sessions will take place. 

### **Meeting Timing**
Robotics is a time consuming club. This is because building, coding, and testing a robot can take a long time. Because of this we have very frequent meetings which range based on which sub-season we are in.
- Pre-season: Durring pre-season we will meet every Wednesday.
- Build Season: Durring build-season we will meet every Wednesday and Saturday to 9 o'clock unless told otherwise by leadership.
- Competition Season: Durring comp season we will meet only on Wednesday unless needed in which you will be informed.
