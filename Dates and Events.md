### **Meeting Timing**
Robotics is a time consuming club. This is because building, coding, and testing a robot can take a long time. Because of this we have very frequent meetings which range based on which sub-season we are in.
- Pre-season: Durring pre-season we will meet every Wednesday.
- Build Season: Durring build-season we will meet every Wednesday and Saturday to 9 o'clock unless told otherwise by leadership.
