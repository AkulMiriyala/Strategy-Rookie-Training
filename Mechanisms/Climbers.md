<h2>Climbers</h2>	
In FIRST Robotics, climbers are a way to lift the robot either above or across distances unnatainable otherwise.
Often in FIRST challenges, the robots are challenged to climb obstacles in which the robot must climb across or onto something whilst also supporting its own weight, accounting for factors such as gravity.
