## **How does a FRC Robot Work?**
FRC robots have several major mechanical parts or components. Each component serves a specific purpose in completing part of the robotâ€™s task. In the real world, an arm of a robot might move it towards something while another piece on that arm completes an action.

*In FRC, the biggest components are the:*

### **Drivetrain:** The drivetrain is what actually moves the robot around. There are a few major types of drivetrain:

1. **6 wheel coast:** This type of drivetrain sees six-wheel arranged so that three are on each side of the robot chassis. This type of drivetrain moves by using tank-like controls to move one section of the robot.

    **Advantages:**
    Fast turning and traction with the ground, good stability control, easy to build, and it is cheap.

    **Disadvantages:**
    The biggest disadvantage you see with this type of drivetrain is a very fixed range of motion you can move the robot. Rather up or down or rotating the bot from its center. In games where we want to be able to face targets at different angles or maneuver from a difficult position, six-wheel coast struggles.

    *This what it looks like:*

2. **Swerve Drive:** The second major type of drivetrain is known as a swerve drivetrain. This method of drivetrain works by moving 4 wheels in 360 degrees allowing us to move in all 8 directions. 

    **Advantages:** This type of drivetrain allows us to have much more maneuverability with the robot and solve many of the problems with six-wheel coast.

    **Disadvantages:** The biggest disadvantages facing swerve drive are its ability to be programmed, price, and difficulty to build. Secondly, swerve drive sacrifices most of the power six-wheel coast can offer and we are forced to play more offensively.

3. **Mecanum Drive:** Another major form of drive, Mecanum drive, uses a special set of wheel called Mecanum wheels. Like a swerve drive, Mecanum has holonomic movement (360 degrees) and can travel in any direction. 

    **Advantages:** This type of drive has a large amount of maneuverability and speed. It is much simpler than swerve in its build an expense, a good compromise between West Coast and swerve.

    **Disadvatnages:** The main disadvatange when it comes to this type of drive as that it greatly limits the power of the robot. This means that if the field is terrained, it will not be very successful. It also means that other robots can easily defend against it by pushing it around.
