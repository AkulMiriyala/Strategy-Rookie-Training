# Programming Rookie Training

Welcome new Talon540 rookies, this document will be used to introduce you guys to how Robotics and Programming a robot work. In programming, your job is to program the robot to use its motors and parts and interact with the world!

## **Introduction to the Team**
Talon540 leadership has several parts and can get confusing quickly. The highest members of Talon's chain of command are our administration members. They consist of Project Manager, Team Captain, and Club Leader.

**For the 2022-23 season, our team Admins are:**
- Project Manager: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->
- Team Captain: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->
- Club Leader: Earl H Hurlburt

Furthermore, each subgroup has its own leads and co-leads. This is done to better manage the team and subgroups as a whole. It also decreases the number of people going to team admins as they can get busy throughout the year.

**Programming has the Following Leadership:**
- Lead: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->
- Second: XXXX <!-- TODO: -->


## **Major Dates and Events & Timing**
- Introduction Interest Meeting: Meet the rest of the team and figure out if Robotics is a good fit for you.
- Pre-season: During this time, rookies are trained and hydra projects are improved.
- Kickoff: Weekend in January when first releases the game video and manual. During this time, the whole team meets and plans designs for the robot. Programming specifically meets to plan what sensors to use on the robot and convey this information to CAD and the rest of the team.
- Build Season: Build season is when we build and test the robot. It has several parts.
    - Planning: From kickoff to around the next meeting. During this time teams create and present robot ideas and we combine or work on them.
    - Build Time: Technical subgroups will meet and work on the robot physically. During this time programming will also meet to plan and begin coding the robot.
    - *Testing Time:* Programming will meet to test robot code and major mechanical peices.
- Competition Season: We compete with the robot.
- After Season: Whether we win or lose, we will compete more in competions in the post season.
- Summer Season: This time is usually used to reflect on what happened the previous year and work on improvement. There are no meetings durring this time.

### **Meeting Timing**
Robotics is a time consuming club. This is because building, coding, and testing a robot can take a long time. Because of this we have very frequent meetings which range based on which sub-season we are in.
- Pre-season: Durring pre-season we will meet every Wednesday.
- Build Season: Durring build-season we will meet every Wednesday and Saturday to 9 o'clock unless told otherwise by leadership.
- Competition Season: Durring comp season we will meet only on Wednesday unless needed in which you will be informed.


## **How does a FRC Robot Work?**
FRC robots have several major mechanical parts or components. Each component serves a specific purpose in completing part of the robotâ€™s task. In the real world, an arm of a robot might move it towards something while another piece on that arm completes an action.

*In FRC, the biggest components are the:*

### **Drivetrain:** The drivetrain is what actually moves the robot around. There are two major types of drivetrain:

1. **6 wheel coast:** This type of drivetrain sees six-wheel arranged so that three are on each side of the robot chassis. This type of drivetrain moves by using tank-like controls to move one section of the robot.

    **Advantages:**
    Fast turning and traction with the ground, good stability control, easy to build, and it is cheap.

    **Disadvantages:**
    The biggest disadvantage you see with this type of drivetrain is a very fixed range of motion you can move the robot. Rather up or down or rotating the bot from its center. In games where we want to be able to face targets at different angles or maneuver from a difficult position, six-wheel coast struggles.

    *This what it looks like:*

2. **Swerve Drive:** The second major type of drivetrain is known as a swerve drivetrain. This method of drivetrain works by moving 4 wheels in 360 degrees allowing us to move in all 8 directions. 

    **Advantages:** This type of drivetrain allows us to have much more maneuverability with the robot and solve many of the problems with six-wheel coast.

    **Disadvantages:** The biggest disadvantages facing swerve drive are its ability to be programmed, price, and difficulty to build. Secondly, swerve drive sacrifices most of the power six-wheel coast can offer and we are forced to play more offensively.

    *This is what a single module looks like:*

    *This is what the whole thing looks like:*

### **Intake:** The intake is the mechanical part of the robot that helps bring balls inside of the robot so that they can be shot.

### **Index:** The Index is the part of the robot that moves balls from inside the drivetrain to the shooter. Without this part balls wouldn't be able to be fired.

### **Shooter:** The shooter is what fires ball out of the robot to a target location or distance.
